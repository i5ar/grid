Isometric Grid Generator
==================

The following demo, called Isometric Grid Generator, allows you to generate isometric grid background,
using two simple sliders (controls cell height and line width),
and then download it as png image.
You can also check the source code yourself and see how it's done.

## TODO

- Transform a polyline to a polygon if the ending point = starting point (but keep it transparent);
- scale image within the grid;
- edit color of restored polygon;
- use shape selection instead of bounding box selection (if possible);
- add rectangle.
